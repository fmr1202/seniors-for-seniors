            <h1>What is Seniors for Seniors? </h1>
            <p>Seniors for Seniors is a project focused on facilitating connection between seniors and senior pets. Our goal is to emphasize the companionship that can come from adopting a senior pet.</p>
            <h2>Senior Spotlight:</h2>
            <img src="assets/edison.jpg">
            <h3>Meet Edison:</h3><p>Edison is a 14-year-old boy looking for his forever home. He's spent the past 5 years in the shelter and is in need of a quiet, laid-back environment. Edison loves to spend his free time doing his two favorite things: napping and eating.</p>

            <h2>Why adopt a senior animal?</h2>
            <p>Senior animals are statistically less likely to be adopted, often because people are looking for the playful energy of a kitten. However, senior animals and their laidback personalities are perfect for someone of an older age who is looking for a companion, and someone to encourage them to establish a routine. Connection with animals increases seratonin, which leads us to be happier and more satisfied with life.</p>
