            <p>One of our long-time residents, Norman, was recently adopted by his new best-friend, Ralph. Ralph says "Bringing Norman home was one of the best decisions I've made in a long time. It makes me happy to have someone by my side all day, who likes to take naps as much as I do!" We're so happy Normal has found his forever home!</p>

            <p>Phil and Noreen reached out to us over the summer, and were interested in adding a member to their family since all of their children and grandchildren no longer lived in the area. After meeting Theo for the first time, they immediately knew he would be the perfect addition and he's been with them ever since!</p>
